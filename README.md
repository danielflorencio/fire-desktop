# Fire - Personal Finance App

Fire is a powerful personal finance app designed to help users take control of their finances, make informed investment decisions, and accelerate their journey to financial independence and early retirement. The app leverages modern technologies to provide real-time financial data, expense tracking, investment simulations, and futuristic financial analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Insights**: Fire fetches data from external APIs to provide users with real-time insights into their preferred stocks, empowering them to make informed investment decisions.
- **Expense Tracking**: Users can effortlessly track their expenses and incomes, gaining visibility into their spending habits and making adjustments to optimize their financial health.
- **Investment Simulator**: The app includes a powerful calculation tool that allows users to simulate the returns on their investments based on different interest rate scenarios, enabling them to plan and strategize for their financial future.
- **Futuristic Financial Analysis**: Fire incorporates a REST microservice built with Java and Spring Boot, which performs advanced analysis of the user's financial data, providing insights and recommendations for improved financial management.
- **Mobile Version**: Currently, the team is developing a mobile version of the application using React Native, ensuring compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, BootStrap, Sass (Scss), TypeScript, Redux Toolkit
- Backend: [Java and Spring Boot](https://github.com/danielflorencio/fire-analytics-microservices)
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Important notes

- **First**: This Readme file is still not complete and does not have all the information about the project.
- **Seconds**: My focus from now on will be on the mobile version of the app, but I intend to keep the development of this Web version in the future using Next Js instead of React and Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Fire app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the backend server with Java and Spring Boot, ensuring a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
4. Configure the necessary environment variables for the frontend and backend.
5. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
6. Use the Expo client app on your mobile device or an emulator to preview and test the app.
